# Code of Conduct

PyGreece is a community of developers that aims to network and collaborate with all Python
developer communities in Greece.

We support the participation of every member of the Python community and we want all
individuals who participate to have an enjoyable and satisfying experience. Consequently,
all participants, speakers, members, organizers, and volunteers at any PyGreece event must
abide by the following Code of Conduct.

## Our community

Some behaviors that describe a member of the PyGreece community are:

- We are always open to partnerships. Community members should always be open to
    collaboration with other members, new volunteers/developers.
- We focus on what is best for the community.
- We respect the processes set out in the community and work within them.
- We recognize time and effort. We respect the volunteer efforts that govern the Python
    community. We are thoughtful when referring to the efforts of others.
- We show empathy to other community members. We are careful in our communications,
    whether in person or online, and are considerate when approaching differing
    viewpoints.
- We encourage members to share their pronouns if they wish, in order to promote respect for all forms of gender identity and expression.
- We respect others, their positions, their abilities, their commitments and their
    efforts. We are receptive to constructive feedback and criticism, as the experiences
    and skills of other members contribute to our overall efforts.
- We graciously accept constructive criticism. When we disagree, we are courteous in
    presenting our issues.
- We use welcoming and inclusive language. We welcome all who wish to participate in our
    activities, fostering an environment where everyone can participate and everyone can
    make a difference.

## Our values

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Python
community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, ethnicity, race, religion (or lack thereof), education, cultural and cognitive
differences, or socioeconomic status.

We recognize and value diversity not only in identity but also in the experiences and perspectives each individual brings to the community. 

Our goal is to provide accessible events and discussions so that members with disabilities can participate without barriers. If there are any needs for additional support, please inform us, and we will do our best to accommodate.

## Examples of inappropriate behavior

- Harassment of any person in any form.
- Intentional bullying, harassment or stalking.
- Recording or taking screenshots of online activity for the purpose of harassment.
- Posting personal information of others, such as physical or email address, without
    express permission.
- Threats of violence or verbal abuse directed at another person.
- Inciting violence or harassment towards any person, including encouraging a person to
    commit suicide or self-harm.
- Creating additional online accounts for the purpose of harassing another person.
- Language and images in the online community on discord or in any venue, including
    speech, that sexualizes, insults, demeans or attacks groups or specific individuals.
- Insults, slurs or jokes based on stereotypes.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
