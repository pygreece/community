# PyGreece Code of Conduct

PyGreece is a community of developers that aims to network and collaborate with all Python
developer communities in Greece.

We support the participation of every member of the Python community and we want all
individuals who participate to have an enjoyable and satisfying experience. Consequently,
all participants, speakers, members, organizers, and volunteers at any PyGreece event must
abide by the following Code of Conduct.

## Our community

Some behaviors that describe a member of the PyGreece community are:

- We are always open to partnerships. Community members should always be open to
  collaboration with other members, new volunteers/developers.
- We focus on what is best for the community.
- We respect the processes set out in the community and work within them.
- We recognize time and effort. We respect the volunteer efforts that govern the Python
  community. We are thoughtful when referring to the efforts of others.
- We show empathy to other community members. We are careful in our communications,
  whether in person or online, and are considerate when approaching differing viewpoints.
- We respect others, their positions, their abilities, their commitments and their
  efforts. We are receptive to constructive feedback and criticism, as the experiences and
  skills of other members contribute to our overall efforts.
- We graciously accept constructive criticism. When we disagree, we are courteous in
  presenting our issues.
- We use welcoming and inclusive language. We welcome all who wish to participate in our
  activities, fostering an environment where everyone can participate and everyone can
  make a difference.

## Our values

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Python
community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, ethnicity, race, religion (or lack thereof), education, cultural and cognitive
differences, or socioeconomic status.

## Examples of inappropriate behavior

- Harassment of any person in any form.
- Intentional bullying, harassment or stalking.
- Recording or taking screenshots of online activity for the purpose of harassment.
- Posting personal information of others, such as physical or email address, without
  express permission.
- Threats of violence or verbal abuse directed at another person.
- Inciting violence or harassment towards any person, including encouraging a person to
  commit suicide or self-harm.
- Creating additional online accounts for the purpose of harassing another person.
- Language and images in the online community on discord or in any venue, including
  speech, that sexualizes, insults, demeans or attacks groups or specific individuals.
- Insults, slurs or jokes based on stereotypes.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Persistent disruption of online community discord discussions, presentations or other
  events.
- Continued personal communication after requests to discontinue such communication.
- Other behavior that is inappropriate for a professional audience that includes
  individuals from many different backgrounds.

Community members who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

## Consequences

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, the PyGreece
organizing team may take such action as it deems appropriate, including warning the
offender or banning the offender (for life or for a specified period of time) from the
community and community events.
