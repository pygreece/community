# PyGreece Code of Conduct

PyGreece is a community of developers that aims to network and collaborate with all Python developer communities in Greece.

We support the participation of every member of the Python community and we want all individuals who participate to have an enjoyable and satisfying experience. Consequently, all participants, speakers, members, organizers, and volunteers at any PyGreece event must abide by the following Code of Conduct.
